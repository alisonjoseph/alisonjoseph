### Hi, I'm Alison 👋

I'm an engineering manager and design engineering lead on [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). I love working in the space where **design meets code**. I lead teams that build our component library, prototype new ideas, and help scale design systems across the business.
