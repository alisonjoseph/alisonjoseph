### Hi, I'm Alison ✨

I'm an engineering manager and design engineering lead on [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). A CSS nerd who loves working in the space where **design meets code**, I'm currently leading teams building our design system, prototyping new ideas, and integrating AI-driven improvements that make it easier for designers and engineers to work together.
